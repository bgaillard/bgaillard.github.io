I am Baptiste Gaillard, an **IT consultant specializing in Platform Engineering, DevOps, Cloud, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**.

With extensive experience in software development, architecture, and **AWS** cloud infrastructures, I help businesses design and implement scalable, efficient, and resilient IT solutionsâ€”reducing operational costs and improving deployment frequency.

I focus on automation, cloud-native architectures (mainly **Kubernetes**), and **AI-driven** process optimization to enhance system reliability and accelerate delivery. By integrating modern tools and best practices, I enable teams to build and maintain high-performance platforms that adapt to evolving needs.

As a consultant, I work closely with organizations to streamline their IT operations, improve deployment workflows, and leverage AI for smarter, faster processes. My goal is to deliver practical, innovative solutions that drive efficiency and support long-term growth.
